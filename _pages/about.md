Hello, I'm Ruinan Jin. Currently, I am pursuing a B.S. (Hon.) in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Throughout my undergraduate journey, I have been fortunate to get the opportunity to work in both the Computer Science industry (through UBC's Coop Program) and Machine Learning research. I gained industrial experience at Amazon Web Services and Sierra Wireless. After the taste of both the industry and research, I am resolute in my decision to pursue interdisciplinary Machine Learning research as my future career. I am also very open to any form of collaboration, please feel free to email me.
