Hello, I'm Ruinan Jin, and I am currently the PhD student focus on medical and trustworthy machine learning. I hold a B.S. (Hon.) in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (UBC). I have also gained rish industry experiences at Google, Amazon Web Services and Sierra Wireless, working on machine learning research and IoT solutions. Below is a list of my research interests, and I am open to various forms of collaboration. If you share any of these interests, please feel free to reach out!

## Research Directions and Past Experiences

<!-- ### Federated Learning
- **Data Heterogeneity**: personalized and heterogeneous federated learning strategies.
- **Distributed Generative Models**: integration of generative adversarial networks (e.g., StyleGAN2-ADA) into federated settings.
- **Privacy**: differential privacy techniques under federated learning.
- **Data Distillation**: data distillation approaches, such as gradient matching and distribution matching, under federated learning.
- **Federated Recommendation System**: integrate deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) into heterogeneous federated learning for efficient communication.
- **New Regime of Federated Learning**: incorporation of textural gradient features into federated optimization. -->

### Trustworthy Machine Learning
My research aims to make modern machine learning systems—especially **foundation and vision-language models (VLMs)** and **federated learning**—more **secure, private, robust, and fair**. I develop both **attacks to diagnose failure modes** and **defenses with measurable guarantees**, with an emphasis on sensitive, real-world domains (e.g., healthcare).

- **Security (Adversaries & Defenses)**: Backdoor attacks and proactive defenses (e.g., adversarial noise); patch-/Fourier-based backdoor insertion and robust aggregation in distributed settings.
- **Privacy (Data Exposure & Unlearning)**: Memorization behavior in modern VLMs and its implications for trust issues (privacy leakage, backdoors, fairness, and out-of-domain data); machine unlearning algorithms; central- and local-model differential privacy; and private synthetic-data generation for sensitive domains.
- **Generalization & Robustness (Deployment Reality)**: Generalization behavior of VLMs and federated learning under distribution shift and heterogeneous clients; robustness-oriented training and evaluation under realistic deployment conditions.
- **Fairness (Measurement & Constraints)**: Bias quantification and group-fairness constraints in medical foundation models and in vision-language settings; evaluation protocols that connect fairness objectives to deployment risk.

<!-- ### Vision-Language Multimodal Models
- **Contrastive Pre-training**: CLIP-family for image-text representation alignment.
- **Generative VL Models**: LLaVA-family for visual question answering, captioning, and multimodal reasoning.
- **Generalization**: in domain and out-of-domain performance benchmark in medical vision-language models.
- **Compositional Learning**: usage of the textual concepts (e.g., concept bottleneck model) to predict intermediate human-interpretable attributes before final decisions. -->
