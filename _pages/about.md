Hello, I'm Name. Currently, I am pursuing the B.S. (Hon.) in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. Throughout my undergraduate journey, I am fortunate to get the opportunity to work in both the Computer Science industry (through UBC's Coop Program) and Machine Learning research. I gained industrial experiences at Amazon Web Services and Sierra Wireless. After the taste in both the industry and research, I am resolute in my decision to pursue research as my future career.

## Research Interest
* Federated Learning (FL)
  * Implemented state-of-the-art FL algorithms, including *FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, Scaffold* into customer settings.
  * Worked on Federated Generative Adversarial Network with *StyleGAN2-ADA*.

* Data Distillation and Generation
  * Adjusted various data distillation strategies to federated learning and compared their pros and cons, including *gradient matching and distribution matching*.
  * Worked on various Generative Adversarial Networks, including *StyleGANs, DCGANs, WGAN and different conditional GANs*.

* Vision-Text Multimodal
  * Worked various vision-text models including *CLIP, MedCLIP, ViLT*.
  * Explored *backdoor attack* on *MedCLIP*.

* Machine Learning Privacy and Security
  * Worked with *membership inference attacks, backdoor attacks (patch and Fourier-based)* and the state-of-the-art defense strategy for them.
  * Worked with the *DP-SGD* algorithm under federated learning and data generation settings for differential privacy.
  * Adjusted unlearning algorithms to compare with the proposed methods, including *gradient ascent* and *finetuning* based algorithms. 
  * Explored different outlier detection algorithm for detecting malicious behavior, including *isolation forest, KNN, PCA and DBSCAN*.
