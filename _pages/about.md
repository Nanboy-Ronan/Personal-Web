Hello, I'm Ruinan Jin, currently graduate student focus on medical and trustworthy machine learning. Previously, I gained a B.S. (Hon.) in Computer Science at UBC. Below is a list of my research interests.

## Research Interest
* Federated Learning (FL)
  * FL algorithms under heterogenous data.
  * Persornalized Federated Learning. 
  * Federated Generative Adversarial Networks.
  * Federated Unlearning.

* Data Distillation and Generation
  * Various data distillation strategies under federated learning setting, including *gradient matching and distribution matching*.
  * Various Generative Adversarial Networks, including *StyleGANs, DCGANs, WGAN and different conditional GANs*.

* Vision-Text Multimodal
  * Various vision-text models including *CLIP, MedCLIP, ViLT*.
  * Machine learning security and privacy on Multimodals.

* Machine Learning Privacy and Security
  * Different attacking algorithms, including *membership inference attacks, backdoor attacks (patch and Fourier-based)* and the state-of-the-art defense strategies for them.
  * Differential privacy, like *DP-SGD* algorithm under federated learning and data generation settings.
  * State-of-the-art machine unlearning algorithms. 
  * Different outlier detection algorithm for detecting malicious behavior, including *isolation forest, KNN, PCA and DBSCAN*.

* Robustness in Optimization
 * Fairness in medical image analysis
 * Fairness embedding of Foundation Models.
