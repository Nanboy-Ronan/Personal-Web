Hello, I'm Ruinan Jin, and I am currently the PhD student focus on medical and trustworthy machine learning. I hold a B.S. (Hon.) in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (UBC). Below is a list of my research interests, and I am open to various forms of collaboration. If you share any of these interests, please feel free to reach out!

## Research Directions and Past Experiences

### Federated Learning
- **Data Heterogeneity**: personalized and heterogeneous federated learning strategies.
- **Distributed Generative Models**: integration of generative adversarial networks (e.g., StyleGAN2-ADA) into federated settings.
- **Privacy**: differential privacy techniques under federated learning.
- **Data Distillation**: data distillation approaches, such as gradient matching and distribution matching, under federated learning.
- **Federated Recommendation System**: integrate deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) into heterogeneous federated learning for efficient communication.
- **New Regime of Federated Learning**: incorporation of textural gradient features into federated optimization.

### Trustworthy Machine Learning
- **Security**: membership-inference attacks, patch / Fourier backdoor insertion, robust aggregation, and certified defense frameworks.
- **Privacy**: central- and local-model differential privacy plus private synthetic-data generation for sensitive domains.
- **Memorization and Unlearning**: memorization behavior of modern vision-language models and its broad implication in the trustworthy machine learning (e.g., backdoor attack, fairness, out-of-domain data and privacy), along with the development and application of machine unlearning algorithms.
- **Fairness**: bias quantification and group-fairness constraints in medical foundation models and vision-language regimes.

### Vision-Language Multimodal Models
- **Contrastive Pre-training**: CLIP-family for image-text representation alignment.
- **Generative VL Models**: LLaVA-family for visual question answering, captioning, and multimodal reasoning.
- **Generalization**: in domain and out-of-domain performance benchmark in medical vision-language models.
- **Compositional Learning**: usage of the textual concepts (e.g., concept bottleneck model) to predict intermediate human-interpretable attributes before final decisions.
